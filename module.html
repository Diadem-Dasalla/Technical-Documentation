<h1> CSS Module</h1>
<p class="e">
	As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules. You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN and many of the documentation pages are organized around a particular module. For example, you could take a look at the MDN reference to the <strong>Backgrounds and Borders</strong> module to find out what its purpose is, and what different properties and other features it contains.<br></p>
<p class="r">
    At this stage you don't need to worry too much about how CSS is structured, however it can make it easier to find information if, for example, you are aware that a certain property is likely to be found among other similar things and are therefore probably in the same specification. <br></p>
<p class="x">
    For a specific example, let's go back to the <code class="w3-codespan" >Backgrounds and Borders </code>module â€” you might think that it makes logical sense for the background-color and border-color properties to be defined in this module. And you'd be right.</p><br>
